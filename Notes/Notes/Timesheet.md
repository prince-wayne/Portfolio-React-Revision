## Before we start

I would like to address that due to both home and weather conditions I was not able to work last week, and I see the possiblity of little work this week, we are officially a week behind (we have a twenty hour weekly goal, not a deadline), but we shall get back to our time line but either finishing early or adding those hours to the coming days/weeks, for example 20 hours missed, adds 10 hours onto coming two weeks.

**1:14 AM**:

Homepage, mostly finished, now we need to create the compondents used on the home page (likely to be used somewhere else)

We will have to wait on the styles until we have react usable by our work station (our computer doesn't have the space needed and a usb drive didn't work, for reasons I can't remember, in the past)

We will now be creating the inline icons compondent, it's purpose is to evenly space the icons within the box given (this sounds like it could just be a css class)

Honesty, looking at the page itself, the usage of compondents would only impact performance, initial load time, and barely affect the reusage of code.

Popups are needed conpondents but that's seperate from this.

**Compondents:**

- pop up overlay `important`

this will send us the message after being opened. So, two parts (open popup, send message)

- cat button

I just say cat, its for the call to action buttons

- project display box

we should look at and practice common naming convenions to help our work be more user/peer readible. 

- skills section 

this will likely just be class based.

Left and come back to this note after working on `catButton`. It doesn't look or feel worth using considering that it's a basic button with an `onClick` function. Perhaps we just use regular buttons instead of over complication. `@the 10x developer.` **Our solution** will me to transform this into a class for styles. 

**Note Exit: 1:34 AM**

**2:01 AM**

We created that popup section, although everything else can be handle through a class instead of a conpondent. 

That being said we won't be able to work on those until we leave the house which will likely will be after our eight hours are clocked. 

our next step will just be creating a  `main.css` file used for classes like these (inline-icons, cat button, etc.), just anything that is general enough to reappear, we only use two buttons types but I'm unsure of the benefit to creating two seperate (or related) compondents for this simple task. 

After that we could consider creating the projects display item. 

**2:06 AM**

**2:36 AM**

I didn't do much, mind seems to be slowing, I'm going to take a short break to refresh, althoug I feel very limited by my current culcumstance. 

I made the skill set compondent, applying the `inline-icons` to it before I forget. Done; 

When we get back from break / rest, depends on if we fall victim to drownieiess (affecting me already), we will work on our projects display, just the setup. We need access to a full computer before we can see the site and ensure functonality.

**break start:**

**2:42 AM**

**break end:**

**3:45 AM**

**4:01 AM**

I think we might have to wait until we might have to wait until we get to the library and use one of there computers, there's so much untested cose (code that hasn't been ran) that it's concerning. 

We need to input the modules and images into the page to truely say we finished but the ground work has be dealt with. 

#### Remaining Task

| Task | Status | Issue |
|-|-|-|
fill images     | placeholders set  | no Wi-fi  | 
install node    | waiting           | no Wi-fi  |
style page      | waiting on images | can't run code|
project display | waiting on React  | useEffect |

can't move foward in this moment without wifi. We shall move forward at a later time today hopefully.

**4:11 AM**
