# Timesheet

**Discontinued Due to disliked structure, as of 1/6/205**

## week one

### Planning and Setup

we watched a quick crash course, our computer doesn't handle the app well but it's manageable. We have our complete home page in Figma. We should go to the library to increase productivity but I'm unsure if it cost any money (Check their website) it would benefit us to get a membership. 

Currently, Friday, 13:32 Time spent 7-10 hours before goal is meant (weekly goal)

Work Days, 24 hours per week, (Breaks are included but don't count as billable hours past half an hour)

Goal for today/tomorrow: 
	Finish Home Page, (Floating Menu button and Menu animation, maybe a couple background gradients) [x]
	Start About Page, (we have assets loaded in but no Images or concepts yet) [x]
	
	This should be manageable if we simply work four two hour periods, also we should use this  to train our attention span. it would be incredible if we could comfortably work for eight hours nonstop. 

Note that we don't have Wi-Fi at the house and this is something we need Wi-Fi for.

We might add an ideas page or blog post throw for us to list ideas and thoughts about a few things. Currently I'm thinking about doing a Finance Tracking app to help me handle my cost easier. iPhone has automations that might allow an app/function to automatically input data into the app whenever a card is used through apple pay or whenever there is a transaction on a card, I remember getting notifications through the bank app in the past and that's how non apple pay functions would work.

We need Icons for our pages, we have an overlay that opens with a hamburger menu icon. 

## December 28, 9:15 PM 
(Saturday Night before Work) 

	We've finished our home page and have overlay connectivity for the playthroughs. Now, we are working on our about page, we need to figure out what we want to do for our section two but I would like to avoid using a picture of myself as I dislike photos being online publicly. 

## Current Tasks) 
		Plan Page (we have most just generate an idea look for the page) 
		Find Image for Section #2 [x]
		Go Back and list the colors we used, anything that we used Hex - Opacity for we should/need to adjust to just be the color itself, which makes things easier in development
		


## Week Two
	**Time of input: Jan 3, 6:17 am**

### Summary
	We haven't worked on it all week long and Some how reversed our planned schedule of work, software based, but we have all of Friday and possibly some of Saturday/Sunday morning if things go smoothly. This could affect our timeline but that's okay has we have a strong design for our home page which ate most of our schedule probably, ask our assistant. 
	
### Plan
	Finish about page, work on the next important one, probably projects, then wrap up the design phase. these will be this week's and next weeks goal, also a solution to losing time here could be allotting more time next week. although it's not needed.

### Current Progress
	I believe we were just past the grided icon section, which i believe was called "what I bring to the table", we could also resort our sections to allow the user to see our skillset page first, but considering we displayed the icons on our home screen and the page is titled "about", it's possible they would want to see information about me over my skill set which i displayed in the home page. 

### Tasks
	-) Finish About
	-) Start Projects (maybe finish)
	-) Ask our assistant if we're on schedule, we didn't write the design part into our plan although we wrote the dev side. 


#### Notes
	We'll get more efficient over time with Figma assuming we continue using it for design, and if we do it would likely build our skillset in design, opening more opportunities for us in the future. 
	Certain aspects of our tools are only available through subscription, consider the benefit of a few.
	Us posting this to Git hub would show us being activate on the site which could help with our job search. 
	if any one viewing these would like to hire me, just contact me, I didn't create this file for review, just personal tracking so forgive me if i missed anything that would upset others.
