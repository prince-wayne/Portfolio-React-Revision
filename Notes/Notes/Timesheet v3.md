# Working Notes

## Summary

We made this file three times now, but this one will work with [text](Tasks.md) From now on. This method should make things easier to track. 

This file will contain notes while the other contains our working tasks. 

## Week X

We are coming from a long peroid of blockage, we haven't had access to any node.js capable computer and our only capable computer lacks enough storage to run this app/site locally, we have a finsihed design, but now we need a new computer to continue. 

there might be room for some edits but I don't want to start building and be stopped short after

additionally, there are often crashes on main computer regardless of isolation. 

we did try using this computer but it wasn't capable (public) of downloading node for me to run the site and vercel is having issues with the build command.
